In general, to update the output that is generated by LLMs, a technique called 'fine-tuning' is used. Fine-tuning requires a set of examples and the corresponding ground truth. In theory, it would be possible to ask human evaluators to look at multiple different versions of movie dialogue summaries and then rank them.
