    "- Use a LLM for text summarization\n",
    "- Apply toxicity metrics to evaluate summaries\n",
    "- Use various toxicity classifiers and libraries\n",

The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about. There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when -- Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? You. LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself. That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free. LaMagra -- The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it. What happens then? A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight. How many of you are there? I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. What happened to the power? Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him. With a retrovirus. It's injected into the bone marrow cells, it causes the host's DNA to mutate``` \n",

I'll take my chances. I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this. Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I? And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge? I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by. How did you escape? Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in -- He killed them? I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- Habit, mostly, just like this. Why do you hunt them? Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience. No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something. The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- What happens if he doesn't take the serum? Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst. We weren't sure we could trust you``` \n",

      "<pad> Whistler! It's because I'm human that I can do this. You're too human, Blade. You don't have a few minutes, Frost. You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. They fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.</s> cockface is a half - breed who 's about to transition into human form . Blade wants him to kill Frost , but Frost refuses . Whistler and Frost fight over Frost 's serum . Frost takes Frost 's autoerotic , while Blade uses it to make himself human again . Frost turns Frost into a half - breed .\n"
