Going somewhere? Don't even start, old man. What took you so long? Wait. Get in. Youre leaving. It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her. Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy. Stupidity. Just do it, old man. I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum -- She hasn't turned yet.  You can help her. You should've killed her, then. She's been bitten. Are we bringing home strays now? Whistler! It's because I'm human that I can do this. You're too human, Blade. You don't have a few minutes, Frost. You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then. Guess you're not quite as invulnerable as you thought. Take him. Who dies first? Frost!!! No longer. Watch me. You're not going anywhere. You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter. Pass. The pause that refreshes --  Care for some? Smells good, doesn't it? Pungent, with just an irrepressible hint of iron. Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete. You're wrong. Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine\u001b[0m\n",

It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, \"the Day-walker\". I dabble in pharmaceuticals, medical research. We've developed a type of sun-blocker using octyl salicylate, a few others things. How can you be out here? Beautiful day, isn't it? You've been here longer than you think. But I just got here -- I am tired. Dawn is coming. How do I stop it? Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst. \"The Blood Tide\". The Day Walker's blood is a disparador -- a trigger, you see? For LaMagra's return. One need only consume it and the spirit of his ancestors will settle upon him.  \"And the Sleeper will rise from the shadows anew, cleansing the world in a Tide of Blood.\" The vampire God. This speaks of His return. Who is LaMagra? This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra. Show me. I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated. Hold out your hands. There are other ways to see. Sit. You're blind -- Is something wrong, my friend? For them. But for me -- I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it? Yes you will. The human side of you is stronger. I know it is.

I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night. You don't look so good. Some. It's been slow -- Any progress? Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card. My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart. We've got a good arrangement, that's all. Whistler makes the weapons, I use them, the vampires die -- end of story. You care about him, don't you? Cancer. Is he sick? For your miracle cure? I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment. Blade -- Just get out of here. If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins. I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human. Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall. I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream. You get used to the darkness. It's dark in here. Serum -- it's a human hemoglobin substitute. What am I injecting you with?

See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman. He will. You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk. Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door? I know this place -- it's a blood bank. Look closer. Graffiti -- What do you see here? What are you looking at? You don't know that. There is no cure. Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself. It's war, now get the fuck out of the way! You can't do this, he's human, it's murder. Preventive medicine. What are you doing?! For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high. And that's a good thing? Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.

He is an abomination! Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for. I see. And what would you have us do with this \"half-breed\"? Why should I respect something which has outlived its purpose? Deacon Frost. You refuse to speak our language, you insult the House of Erebus by using the humans' gutter-tongue, have you no respect for tradition? The Day Walker represents a unique opportunity. We'd be fools to waste it by killing him. You're wrong, Dragonetti. Blade. Once again, our interests have fallen victim to his ridiculous crusade. He must be destroyed. Get away from him! I was wrong about you, Blade. You were never one of us. You're a traitor to your race. You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip. Blade -- Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids?

Whistler and I were working on a cure when -- Who better to usher in the Blood Tide? You. LaMagra isn't a physical being. He's a spirit, requiring a flesh and blood host in order to manifest himself. That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free. LaMagra -- The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it. What happens then? A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight. How many of you are there? I don't know, but the back-up generator should've kicked in. What happened to the power? Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins. On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.

He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by. How did you escape? Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in -- He killed them? I had a family once -- a wife, three daughters. Then a drifter named Deacon Frost came calling one evening -- Habit, mostly, just like this. Why do you hunt them? Which is why you're here. We could use someone with your experience. No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something. The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure -- What happens if he doesn't take the serum? Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly.

In general, to update the output that is generated by LLMs, a technique called 'fine-tuning' is used. Fine-tuning requires a set of examples and the corresponding ground truth. In theory, it would be possible to ask human evaluators to look at multiple different versions of movie dialogue summaries and then rank them. However, this is time consuming and therefore it makes sense to repurpose the toxicity model and use the toxicity values as signal for what is considered good (no toxicity) and bad (toxicity). This helper model, is the so-called reward model.\n",
