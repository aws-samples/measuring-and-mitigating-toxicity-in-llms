    "Building and operating machine learning applications responsibly requires an active, consistent approach to prevent, assess, and mitigate harm. This workshop gives you hands-on experience to identify toxicity in LLM output and to mitigate and reduce toxicity.\n",

    "In this workshop you will:\n",
    "1. <a href=\"#1\">Define the problem:</a> load a dataset and look at examples\n",
    "2. <a href=\"#2\">Explore the starting toxicity:</a> format data and apply a classifier\n",
    "3. <a href=\"#3\">Use a LLM to generate summaries:</a> load the model, create prompts, explore output\n",
    "4. <a href=\"#4\">Evaluate summaries for toxicity:</a> apply the toxicity classifier, compare toxicity values\n",
    "5. <a href=\"#5\">Mitigate toxicity using guardrails:</a> hide unwanted words and filter profanity\n",
    "6. <a href=\"#6\">(optional) Reduce toxicity using a Direct Optimization Policy (DPO):</a> fine-tune with toxicity data and compare to original model\n",

    "Some cells take time to run. An asterisk `[*]` next to the cell means it is still running. A number `[1]` next to the cell shows you the order in which the cells were exectued.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook is memory-intensive. Run cleanup cells at the end of each section. If you see an OutOfMemoryError, just restart your kernel and jump back into the notebook at the beginning of your current section.\n",
